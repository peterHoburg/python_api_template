# Python API Template (PAT)

## Project Vision and Purpose

The Python API Template (PAT) is a comprehensive, production-ready FastAPI repository template designed to accelerate the development of new API projects. It serves as a solid foundation that:

* Provides a standardized, best-practice approach to building modern Python APIs
* Reduces boilerplate code and setup time for new projects
* Ensures consistent architecture and patterns across multiple projects
* Incorporates security, performance, and maintainability from the start

## Core Principles

* **Best Practices First**: Follows all current Python, FastAPI, CRUD, API, security, and software engineering best practices
* **Functional Over OOP**: Prefers functional programming paradigms over object-oriented programming when possible
* **Type Safety**: Leverages Python's type hints throughout for better code quality and IDE support
* **Backward Compatibility**: All API endpoints are versioned, and all changes within a version maintain backward compatibility
* **Testability**: Designed with testing in mind, making it easy to write comprehensive tests
* **Developer Experience**: Optimized for a smooth developer experience with helpful tooling and clear patterns

## Technology Stack

### Core Technologies
* **FastAPI**: Modern, high-performance web framework for building APIs
* **SQLAlchemy**: SQL toolkit and Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library with async support
* **Alembic**: Database migration tool for SQLAlchemy
* **PostgreSQL**: Advanced open-source relational database
* **Pydantic**: Data validation and settings management using Python type annotations
* **Auth0**: Authentication and authorization platform
* **Logfire**: Structured logging for better observability
* **UV**: Fast Python package installer and resolver

### Development Tools
* **Docker & Docker Compose**: Containerization for consistent development and deployment environments
* **Pytest**: Testing framework with async support
* **Ruff**: Fast Python linter and formatter
* **Pyright**: Static type checker for Python
* **Make**: Task automation for common development workflows

## Architecture Overview

The project follows a clean, modular architecture:

* **API Layer**: FastAPI routes and endpoints
* **Service Layer**: Business logic and operations
* **Data Access Layer**: Database interactions via SQLAlchemy
* **Schema Layer**: Data models and validation with Pydantic and SQLAlchemy

The application uses asynchronous programming throughout for optimal performance, with proper connection pooling and resource management.

## Development Workflow

The project includes several make commands to streamline development:

* `make lint`: Run code formatting and static analysis
* `make run`: Start the application in development mode
* `make test`: Run the test suite
* `make generate_migrations`: Generate database migration scripts

## Future Roadmap

* Additional authentication methods and authorization patterns
* Performance optimization and benchmarking tools
* CI/CD pipeline templates
* Expanded test coverage and examples
* Deployment templates for various cloud providers
