# Plan for TICKET-005B: Implement request/response models

## Overview
This ticket involves creating Pydantic models for API requests and responses. These models will ensure proper validation and documentation for all API endpoints. The models will build upon the existing base models in the project.

## Current State
- The project has base Pydantic models (BaseSchema, BaseCreateSchema, BaseUpdateSchema, BaseResponseSchema)
- There are User-specific models (UserBase, UserCreate, UserUpdate, UserResponse)
- There are error response models (ErrorResponse, ValidationErrorDetail, ValidationErrorResponse)
- There are standardized response wrappers (SuccessResponse, ErrorResponse)
- There is a health check endpoint (/v1/health) but it doesn't use a standardized response model

## Goals
1. Define models for all existing API endpoints
2. Implement proper validation rules for all models
3. Add documentation for each model
4. Ensure all API endpoints use the standardized response models

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Create Health Check Response Model
- Create a HealthCheckResponse model for the existing health check endpoint
- Update the health check endpoint to use the new model
- Add proper documentation to the model

### 2. Create Common Response Models
- Create a PaginatedResponse model for paginated results
- Create a MessageResponse model for simple message responses
- Add proper documentation to these models

### 3. Create User API Models
- Create request/response models for User API endpoints (if they will be implemented)
- Add proper validation rules to these models
- Add documentation to these models

### 4. Update API Endpoints
- Update existing endpoints to use the new models
- Ensure all responses are properly wrapped in SuccessResponse

### 5. Write Tests
- Write tests for all new models
- Ensure validation rules work as expected
- Test API endpoints with the new models

## Success Criteria
- All API endpoints use standardized request/response models
- All models have proper validation rules
- All models have comprehensive documentation
- All tests pass
