# Plan for TICKET-006C: Create role-based access control

## Overview
This ticket involves implementing a role-based access control (RBAC) system for the application. The RBAC system will allow for fine-grained control over what actions users can perform based on their assigned roles.

## Approach

### 1. Define Role Structure
- Create a Role model that will store role information
- Implement a Permission enum to define available permissions
- Design a many-to-many relationship between roles and permissions
- Ensure roles can be hierarchical (roles can inherit permissions from other roles)

### 2. Implement Permission Checking
- Create utility functions to check if a user has a specific permission
- Implement decorators for route functions to enforce permission requirements
- Add middleware to validate permissions for protected routes
- Ensure permission checking is efficient and doesn't impact performance

### 3. Create Role Assignment Functionality
- Implement functions to assign roles to users
- Create endpoints for role management (admin only)
- Add functionality to update and remove roles
- Ensure role changes are properly reflected in the user's permissions

## Technical Considerations
- Use SQLAlchemy for the database models
- Implement Pydantic schemas for validation
- Ensure all operations are async-compatible
- Add proper error handling for permission denied scenarios
- Write comprehensive tests for all RBAC functionality

## Dependencies
- Auth0 integration (TICKET-006A)
- JWT validation (TICKET-006B)

## Expected Outcome
A complete role-based access control system that restricts access based on user roles, with the ability to assign, update, and remove roles as needed.
