# Plan for TICKET-004A: Configure PostgreSQL connection settings

## Overview
This ticket involves enhancing the PostgreSQL connection settings in the application. The goal is to make the database connection configuration more robust, flexible, and environment-specific.

## Current State
- Basic PostgreSQL configuration exists in `src/pat/config.py`
- Database connection handling is implemented in `src/pat/utils/db.py`
- Connection pooling parameters are hardcoded in `src/pat/utils/db.py`
- Environment-specific configuration is partially implemented through the `EnvironmentType` enum
- Test database configuration is defined in `tests/fixtures/consts.py`

## Approach
1. **Make connection pooling parameters configurable**
   - Add configuration options for pool_size, max_overflow, pool_timeout, pool_recycle, and pool_pre_ping to the Settings class
   - Set appropriate default values for different environments

2. **Implement environment-specific configuration**
   - Enhance the Settings class to use different default values based on the environment
   - Ensure that all settings can be overridden through environment variables

3. **Improve error handling for connection issues**
   - Review and enhance the existing retry logic for database connections
   - Add more detailed logging for connection issues

4. **Add documentation for configuration options**
   - Add docstrings to explain each configuration option
   - Document the environment variables that can be used to override the defaults

## Expected Outcome
- Properly configured PostgreSQL connection settings that can be easily adjusted for different environments
- Improved reliability through better error handling and retry logic
- Clear documentation for all configuration options
