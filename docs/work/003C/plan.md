# Plan for TICKET-003C: Document migration workflow

## Objective
Create comprehensive documentation for the database migration workflow using Alembic. This documentation will help developers understand how to create, apply, and roll back migrations, as well as follow best practices for migration management.

## Background
The project uses Alembic for database migrations. Previous tickets (003A and 003B) have set up the basic Alembic configuration and created initial migration scripts. Now we need to document the migration workflow to ensure all developers can effectively manage database migrations.

## Approach
1. Research the current Alembic setup in the project to understand how it's configured
2. Examine the existing migration scripts to understand the current patterns
3. Create documentation that covers:
   - How to create new migrations
   - How to apply migrations
   - How to roll back migrations
   - Best practices for migration management
4. Include practical examples for each operation
5. Add troubleshooting information for common issues

## Implementation Details
1. The documentation will be created in a Markdown file in the project's documentation directory
2. The documentation will include:
   - Overview of Alembic and its role in the project
   - Step-by-step instructions for creating migrations
   - Commands for applying and rolling back migrations
   - Best practices section with guidelines
   - Examples of common migration scenarios
   - Troubleshooting section

## Deliverables
1. A comprehensive Markdown document that explains the migration workflow
2. Examples of common migration operations
3. Best practices for migration management

## Success Criteria
- The documentation is clear and easy to follow
- All required topics (creation, application, rollback, best practices) are covered
- Examples are provided for common scenarios
- The documentation helps developers effectively manage database migrations
