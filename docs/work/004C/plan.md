# Plan for TICKET-004C: Create database initialization scripts

## Overview
This ticket focuses on developing scripts for initializing the database, implementing data seeding functionality, and ensuring these scripts are idempotent (can be run multiple times without causing issues). The goal is to create reliable scripts that can initialize the database in any environment.

## Current Implementation Analysis
Currently, the project has:
1. A robust database connection setup with retry mechanisms in `src/pat/utils/db.py`
2. Alembic configured for database migrations
3. Docker Compose setup for PostgreSQL in development and testing environments
4. Makefile commands for running the application, tests, and generating migrations

However, there is no dedicated functionality for:
1. Database initialization beyond running migrations
2. Data seeding for development, testing, or production environments
3. Idempotent scripts that can be safely run multiple times

## Improvement Areas
1. Create scripts for database setup that go beyond just applying migrations
2. Implement data seeding functionality for different environments
3. Ensure all scripts are idempotent and can be safely run multiple times
4. Add Makefile commands for database initialization and seeding
5. Document the database initialization process

## Implementation Plan
1. Create a new module `src/pat/utils/db_init.py` for database initialization functions
2. Implement functions for checking if the database exists and creating it if needed
3. Create functions for applying migrations as part of the initialization process
4. Implement data seeding functionality with environment-specific seed data
5. Ensure all functions are idempotent by checking current state before making changes
6. Add Makefile commands for database initialization and seeding
7. Create tests to verify the initialization and seeding functionality
8. Document the database initialization process

## Technical Approach
- Use SQLAlchemy and Alembic for database operations
- Implement async functions for all database operations
- Use environment variables to control initialization behavior
- Create a clear separation between schema initialization and data seeding
- Implement logging for all initialization steps
- Add comprehensive error handling with appropriate recovery strategies
- Create unit and integration tests to verify functionality
