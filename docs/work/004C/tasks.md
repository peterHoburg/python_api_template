# Tasks for TICKET-004C: Create database initialization scripts

## Task List

1. [x] Create a new module `src/pat/utils/db_init.py` for database initialization functions
   - [x] Set up the basic module structure with imports and docstrings
   - [x] Define the module's public interface

2. [x] Implement functions for checking if the database exists and creating it if needed
   - [x] Create a function to check if the database exists
   - [x] Implement a function to create the database if it doesn't exist
   - [x] Add error handling and logging for database creation

3. [x] Create functions for applying migrations as part of the initialization process
   - [x] Implement a function to check the current migration status
   - [x] Create a function to apply pending migrations
   - [x] Add error handling and logging for migration application

4. [x] Implement data seeding functionality with environment-specific seed data
   - [x] Create a data seeding framework with environment detection
   - [x] Implement seed data for development environment
   - [x] Implement seed data for testing environment
   - [x] Add support for production environment seeding (if applicable)
   - [x] Ensure seed data is properly typed and validated

5. [x] Ensure all functions are idempotent by checking current state before making changes
   - [x] Add state checking before database creation
   - [x] Implement checks before applying migrations
   - [x] Add checks before seeding data to prevent duplicates
   - [x] Test idempotence by running scripts multiple times

6. [x] Add Makefile commands for database initialization and seeding
   - [x] Create a `db-init` command for initializing the database
   - [x] Add a `db-seed` command for seeding data
   - [x] Implement a combined `db-setup` command for both initialization and seeding
   - [x] Update documentation for the new commands

7. [x] Create tests to verify the initialization and seeding functionality
   - [x] Implement unit tests for individual functions
   - [x] Create integration tests for the complete initialization process
   - [x] Add tests for idempotence verification
   - [x] Ensure tests work in CI environment

8. [x] Document the database initialization process
   - [x] Update project README with information about database initialization
   - [x] Create detailed documentation for the initialization process
   - [x] Add examples and usage instructions
   - [x] Document environment-specific configurations
