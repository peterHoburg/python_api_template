# Plan for TICKET-004B: Implement connection handling with retries

## Overview
This ticket focuses on enhancing the database connection handling with robust retry mechanisms, backoff strategies, and proper error handling. While some basic retry functionality already exists in the codebase, we need to improve and extend it to handle various connection scenarios more effectively.

## Current Implementation Analysis
The current implementation in `src/pat/utils/db.py` includes:
1. Basic retry configuration for transient database errors
2. Connection retry configuration for initial connection
3. An `init_con()` function that initializes the database connection with retries
4. An `execute_with_retry()` function for executing SQL statements with retry logic

## Improvement Areas
1. Enhance the connection retry mechanism to handle more scenarios beyond initial connection
2. Implement a more sophisticated backoff strategy with error categorization
3. Improve error handling with detailed logging and recovery strategies
4. Add connection health checks and recovery mechanisms

## Implementation Plan
1. Refactor the existing retry configurations to be more flexible and configurable
2. Implement a connection manager class to handle connection lifecycle
3. Add connection health check functionality
4. Enhance error handling with categorization and appropriate recovery strategies
5. Implement a more sophisticated backoff strategy
6. Add comprehensive logging for connection events
7. Create tests to verify the retry and recovery mechanisms

## Technical Approach
- Use the `tenacity` library for retry logic
- Implement async context managers for connection handling
- Use SQLAlchemy events for connection monitoring
- Add detailed logging with `logfire` for observability
- Create unit and integration tests to verify functionality
