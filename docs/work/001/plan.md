# Plan for TICKET-001: Implement FastAPI application structure with versioned endpoints

## Overview
This ticket involves setting up the foundational FastAPI application structure with proper routing, middleware configuration, and API versioning. The goal is to create a clean, well-organized API structure that follows RESTful principles and is easy to extend.

## Approach

1. **API Versioning Strategy**
   - Implement API versioning using path prefixes (e.g., `/api/v1/`, `/api/v2/`)
   - Set up a router structure that allows for multiple API versions to coexist
   - Ensure backward compatibility is maintained when new versions are added

2. **Application Structure**
   - Create a modular application structure with separate routers for different resource types
   - Implement a clean main.py file that initializes the FastAPI application with all necessary configurations
   - Set up proper dependency injection patterns for services

3. **Error Handling and Response Formatting**
   - Implement global exception handlers for different types of errors
   - Create standardized response models for success and error cases
   - Ensure consistent error codes and messages across the API

4. **Security Configuration**
   - Set up CORS middleware with appropriate settings
   - Configure security headers to protect against common web vulnerabilities
   - Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse

5. **Documentation**
   - Configure Swagger/OpenAPI documentation with proper descriptions and examples
   - Add docstrings to all endpoints and functions
   - Ensure documentation is automatically generated and up-to-date

## Expected Outcome
A working FastAPI application with versioned endpoints that follows RESTful principles, has proper error handling, and includes security configurations. The structure should be clean, maintainable, and easy to extend with new endpoints and versions.
