# Plan for TICKET-003B: Create initial migration scripts

## Overview
This ticket involves developing the initial migration scripts for the database schema. We need to generate migration scripts for existing models, test their application and rollback functionality, and ensure they work across different environments.

## Approach
1. **Review existing models**: Examine the current SQLAlchemy models to understand the database schema that needs to be migrated.
2. **Generate initial migration script**: Use Alembic to generate the initial migration script based on the existing models.
3. **Test migration application**: Apply the migration to a test database and verify that the schema is correctly created.
4. **Test migration rollback**: Test the rollback functionality to ensure migrations can be reversed if needed.
5. **Environment compatibility**: Ensure the migrations work in different environments (development, testing, production) by testing with different database configurations.
6. **Documentation**: Add comments to the migration scripts to explain the changes and any special considerations.

## Technical Considerations
- Ensure that the migration scripts are idempotent (can be run multiple times without causing errors).
- Handle any existing data appropriately during migrations.
- Consider database-specific features and ensure compatibility across different database engines if needed.
- Implement proper error handling for migration failures.
- Ensure that the migration scripts are properly versioned and can be applied in sequence.

## Success Criteria
- Initial migration scripts are generated and properly versioned.
- Migrations can be applied successfully to create the database schema.
- Migrations can be rolled back successfully.
- Migrations work in different environments with different database configurations.
- Migration scripts are well-documented with clear comments.
