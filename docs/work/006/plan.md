# Plan for TICKET-006A: Set up Auth0 Integration

## Overview
This ticket involves setting up the basic Auth0 integration for our FastAPI application. Auth0 is a flexible, drop-in solution to add authentication and authorization services to applications. We'll configure the Auth0 client, implement the authentication flow, and set up callback handling.

## Approach

### 1. Auth0 Client Configuration
- Create configuration settings for Auth0 in our application
- Set up environment variables for Auth0 domain, client ID, and client secret
- Implement a configuration class to manage Auth0 settings

### 2. Authentication Flow Implementation
- Set up the necessary endpoints for authentication
- Implement the login and logout functionality
- Create utility functions for generating and validating Auth0 URLs

### 3. Callback Handling
- Implement callback endpoint to handle Auth0 responses
- Set up token exchange functionality
- Create session management for authenticated users

## Technical Considerations
- We'll use the Auth0 Python SDK for integration
- We need to ensure secure handling of tokens and credentials
- The implementation should be compatible with our existing FastAPI structure
- We should follow best practices for authentication security

## Dependencies
- Auth0 Python SDK
- FastAPI security utilities
- Environment configuration for storing Auth0 credentials

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for Auth0 configuration and utility functions
- Integration tests for authentication flow
- Mock Auth0 responses for testing callback handling
