# Plan for TICKET-003A: Configure Alembic initial setup

## Overview
This ticket involves setting up Alembic for database migrations in the Python API Template (PAT) project. Alembic is a database migration tool for SQLAlchemy that allows for versioned database schema changes.

## Goals
- Install and configure Alembic
- Set up the Alembic directory structure
- Configure Alembic to work with the SQLAlchemy models

## Implementation Steps

1. Verify that Alembic is installed in the project dependencies
   - Check if Alembic is already in the project dependencies
   - If not, add it to the project dependencies

2. Set up the Alembic directory structure
   - Initialize Alembic with the appropriate configuration
   - Ensure the Alembic directory structure is created correctly

3. Configure Alembic to work with SQLAlchemy models
   - Update the Alembic environment configuration to use the SQLAlchemy models
   - Configure the database connection settings
   - Set up the target metadata for migrations

4. Test the Alembic configuration
   - Verify that Alembic can detect the SQLAlchemy models
   - Ensure that Alembic can generate migration scripts

## Technical Considerations
- Alembic should be configured to work with the async SQLAlchemy setup
- The configuration should support different environments (development, testing, production)
- The migration scripts should be idempotent and reversible

## Acceptance Criteria
- Alembic is properly installed and configured
- The Alembic directory structure is set up correctly
- Alembic is configured to work with the SQLAlchemy models
- The configuration can be used to generate and apply migrations
