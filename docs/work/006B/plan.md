# Plan for TICKET-006B: Implement JWT validation

## Overview
This ticket involves implementing secure JWT (JSON Web Token) validation for the Python API Template (PAT). JWT validation is a critical security component that ensures the integrity and authenticity of tokens used for authentication. We'll build on the Auth0 integration from TICKET-006A to implement robust token validation mechanisms.

## Approach

### 1. JWT Token Validation Implementation
- Review the existing token validation in the Auth0 utilities
- Enhance the validation to include comprehensive checks
- Implement proper error handling for validation failures
- Create reusable validation functions that can be used across the application

### 2. Signature Verification Setup
- Implement proper signature verification using the Auth0 public keys
- Set up JWKS (JSON Web Key Set) retrieval and caching
- Implement asymmetric signature verification
- Create fallback mechanisms for signature verification failures

### 3. Token Expiration Handling
- Implement token expiration validation
- Add handling for token refresh when tokens expire
- Create mechanisms to detect and handle clock skew
- Implement proper error responses for expired tokens

## Technical Considerations
- We'll use the python-jose library for JWT operations
- We'll implement caching for JWKS to improve performance
- We'll follow OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect standards
- We'll ensure proper security measures for token validation
- We'll make the validation configurable for different environments

## Dependencies
- python-jose for JWT operations
- httpx for asynchronous HTTP requests
- Auth0 Python SDK for integration with Auth0
- FastAPI for endpoint implementation
- Pydantic for data validation

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for token validation functions
- Mock-based tests for JWKS retrieval
- Integration tests for the complete validation flow
- Security tests to ensure proper validation of tampered tokens
