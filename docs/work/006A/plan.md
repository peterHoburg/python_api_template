# Plan for TICKET-006A: Set up Auth0 integration

## Overview
This ticket involves setting up the basic Auth0 integration for the Python API Template (PAT). Auth0 is a flexible, drop-in solution for adding authentication and authorization services to applications. We'll implement the core functionality needed to authenticate users via Auth0.

## Approach

### 1. Auth0 Configuration Setup
- Create configuration classes/functions to store and manage Auth0-related settings
- Implement environment variable loading for Auth0 credentials
- Set up configuration validation to ensure all required Auth0 settings are provided

### 2. Authentication Flow Implementation
- Implement the OAuth 2.0 authorization code flow
- Create utility functions for generating authorization URLs
- Implement token exchange functionality
- Set up token validation and verification
- Create user profile retrieval from Auth0

### 3. Callback Handling
- Implement callback endpoint for Auth0 redirects
- Create session management for authenticated users
- Implement error handling for authentication failures
- Set up proper response handling for successful authentication

## Technical Considerations
- We'll use the Auth0 Python SDK where appropriate
- We'll follow the OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect standards
- We'll ensure proper security measures are in place for token handling
- We'll make the integration configurable for different environments

## Dependencies
- Auth0 Python SDK
- FastAPI for endpoint implementation
- Pydantic for configuration validation
- Python-jose for JWT handling

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for configuration validation
- Mock-based tests for Auth0 API interactions
- Integration tests for authentication flow
- End-to-end tests for the complete authentication process
